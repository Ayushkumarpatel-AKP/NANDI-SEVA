# **App Name**: CowHealth AI

## Core Features:

- Image Analysis: Analyze uploaded images of cows using a machine learning model to detect the presence of a cow, identify the breed, describe the color and markings, and detect visible signs of disease or abnormalities. If disease detected, the model should display any suspected conditions or respond with 'No visible disease signs' if the cow appears healthy. This AI feature will act as a tool.
- Image Input: Provide a user-friendly interface for uploading cow images or using a device's camera to capture images directly within the app.
- Result Display: Display the results of the image analysis, including breed identification, color description, and disease detection results, highlighting affected areas on the image and providing suggestions for possible treatments. Present results in a clear, organized manner with visual cues for easy understanding.
- Dashboard Interface: Incorporate a dashboard-style interface with options for image uploads, scan progress animation, and detailed result sections. The dashboard will provide an overview of recent analyses and key insights.
- Data Storage: Store analysis history and cow profiles (if the user chooses to create them) in a Firestore database for easy access and tracking.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: White or light gray for a clean, professional look.
- Secondary color: A muted green or blue to evoke a sense of health and reliability.
- Accent: A warm yellow (#FFC107) for highlights and calls to action.
- Use clear, sans-serif fonts for readability.
- Employ simple, recognizable icons to represent different functions and data points.
- Design a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring usability on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Incorporate subtle animations during the image processing stage to provide visual feedback to the user.

## Original User Request:
Cow Detection: Determine whether the image contains a cow. Respond with:

Yes if a cow is present.

No if a cow is not present.

If a cow is present, proceed with the following steps:

a. Breed Identification: Identify the breed of the cow (e.g., Holstein, Jersey, Gir, Sahiwal, etc.).
b. Color Detection: Describe the primary color and any significant markings (e.g., black and white, brown, reddish, spotted).
c. Disease Detection: Check the cow for visible signs of illness or abnormality (e.g., skin lesions, swelling, eye or nose discharge, abnormal posture). List any suspected conditions or respond with No visible disease signs if the cow appears healthy.I want to create an interactive website that allows users to upload or scan an image of a cow. The website should analyze the cowâ€™s skin from the image and detect any potential skin diseases or abnormalities using machine learning. The UI should be user-friendly and visually engaging, providing clear results, visual highlights on the affected areas, and suggestions for possible treatments. Include a dashboard-style interface with upload options, scan progress animation, and detailed result sections. Target users are farmers and veterinarians, so the language and design should be simple yet professional.
